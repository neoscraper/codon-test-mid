    /*  
     *  The genetic code is a set of rules by which DNA or mRNA is translated into proteins (amino acid sequences).
     *  
     *  1) Three nucleotides (or tri-nucleotide), called codons, specify which amino acid will be used.
     *  2) Since codons are defined by three nucleotides, every sequence can be read in three reading frames, depending on the starting point.
     *     The actual reading frame used for translation is determined by a start codon. 
     *     In our case, we will define the start codon to be the most commonly used ATG (in some organisms there may be other start codons).
     *  3) Translation begins with the start codon, which is translated as Methionine (abbreviated as 'M').
     *  4) Translation continues until a stop codon is encountered. There are three stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA)
     *  
     * 
     *  Included in this project is a comma seperated value (CSV) text file with the codon translations.
     *  Each line of the file has the codon, followed by a space, then the amino acid (or start or stop)
     *  For example, the first line:
     *  CTA,L
     *  should be interpreted as: "the codon CTA is translated to the amino acid L"
     *  
     *  
     *  You should not assume that the input sequence begins with the start codon. Any nucleotides before the start codon should be ignored.
     *  You should not assume that the input sequence ends with the stop codon. Any nucleotides after the stop codon should be ignored.
     * 
     *  For example, if the input DNA sequence is GAACAAATGCATTAATACAAAAA, the output amino acid sequence is MH.
     *  GAACAA ATG CAT TAA TACAAAAA
     *         \ / \ /
     *          M   H
     *          
     *  ATG -> START -> M
     *  CAT -> H
     *  TAA -> STOP
